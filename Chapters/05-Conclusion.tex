In conclusion, this lab successfully established an accurate calibration relationship in the wind tunnel, using dynamic pressure and pressure differentials. Through experimentation and analysis, we were able to determine the calibration constant, $K$. We also found a linear relationship between the motor frequency and the air velocity. These two findings allow us to accurately predict air speed within the tunnel, which will be crucial in following experiments.  \par
