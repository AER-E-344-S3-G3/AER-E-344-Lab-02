Using a pitot tube and a manometer, we recorded pressure data from the low-speed wind tunnel. By analyzing this data in \acrshort{matlab} and utilizing a polynomial fit function, we calculated the calibration coefficient, \gls{K}. This calibration coefficient relates a static pressure differential to the dynamic pressure in the test chamber, which can further be evaluated to find the airspeed in the test chamber. The calibration coefficient and relationships we derived will allow us to more accurately estimate the airspeed in the wind tunnel during future experiments.
