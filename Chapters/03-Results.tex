For the first part of the experiment, we needed to find the calibration constant ($K$). This was achieved by comparing the dynamic pressure and the pressure difference between Points $A$ and $E$. Through some equation manipulation, we determined that the slope obtained from the graph represents the calibration constant we are seeking. In this case, we found that $K$ equals 1.07907. \\

The next part of the lab involved utilizing the calibration constant to establish a relationship between the motor speed in Hz and the air velocity inside the wind tunnel. Subsequently, we derived a formula that correlates the air velocity ($v_T$) with the motor speed ($\omega _{motor}$), resulting in the equation $v_T = 1.32372 * \omega _{motor} - 0.430966$. Using this formula, one can input any motor speed to obtain a close estimate for the air speed in the wind tunnel. \\
