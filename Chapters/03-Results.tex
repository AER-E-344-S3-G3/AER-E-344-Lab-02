\autoref{fig:dynamic_pressure_graph} shows the dynamic pressure in the test chamber, \gls{q_T}, as a function of the pressure differential, \gls{DeltaP}, between the static pressures measured at points A and E. The slope of this graph, defined as the calibration constant, \gls{K}, is \num{1.08}.

\autoref{fig:velocity_graph} shows the airspeed in the test chamber, \gls{v_T}, as a function of the motor frequency, \gls{omega_motor}. This plot can be used to determine the approximate test chamber airspeed for a given motor frequency. By using the \verb|polyfit()| function in \acrshort{matlab} (see \autoref{sec:calc_velocity}), we calculated the linear regression to be

\begin{equation}\label{eq:velocity_regression}
    v_T = 1.32\omega_{motor}-0.431
\end{equation}
